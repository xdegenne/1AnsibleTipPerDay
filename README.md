# Ansible Trip AKA One Ansible tip per day AKA Ansible4Dummies

Hi all.

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/resources/get-started) is a great tool for automating stuffs.

I decided to write these Ansible pieces of code to help others start with it.

I'll try to regularly posts tips always having educational concerns in mind.

Apologize for my english (this is also an excercice for me !). Feel free to contribute.

Good trip.

# Ansible Trip AKA One Ansible tip per day AKA Ansible4Dummies

Hi all.

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/resources/get-started) is a great tool for automating stuffs.

I decided to write these Ansible pieces of code in order to help anyone who wants to start playing with it without pain.

It's a kind of _5 minutes twice a day_ trip. Feel free to use it at your convenance, but if you want to progress, you have to practice (like with yoga, music, sport, and so on ...) !

I'll try to regularly posts tips always having educational concerns in mind.

Apologize for my english (this is also an exercice for me !). Feel free to contribute.

If you have questions, feel free to create issues, fork, pull request, this is opensourced, just contribute ! I'll try to follow.

Good trip.

# Prerequisites

* Having git installed and now how to *a minima* how to clone and pull.
* Having a YAML editor (I love [Atom](https://atom.io/) but YAML is just text so at worst, notepad can help you) and know [basis about YAML](https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/).

# How-to use

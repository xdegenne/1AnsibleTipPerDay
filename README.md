# Ansible Trip AKA One Ansible tip per day AKA Ansible4Dummies

Hi all.

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/resources/get-started) is a great tool for automating stuffs.

I decided to write these Ansible pieces of code in order to help anyone who wants to play with it without pain.

It's a kind of _2*5 minutes a day_ trip. Feel free to use it at your convenance, but if you want to progress (like in yoga, music, sport, and so on ...) you have to practice.

I'll try to regularly posts tips always having educational concerns in mind.

Apologize for my english (this is also an exercice for me !). Feel free to contribute.

Good trip.

# How-to use

```
git clone https://github.com/xdegenne/1AnsibleTipPerDay.git

Let's [start](Day001am - Install Ansible) by the first day tip.
